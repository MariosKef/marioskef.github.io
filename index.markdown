Hi there,

My name is Marios Kefalas and I am a machine learning engineer at [Slimmer AI](https://www.slimmer.ai/). Previous to this I was working as a researcher and PhD candidate at the [Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS)](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/) at Leiden University in The Netherlands, working at the [CIMPLO](https://cimplo.nl/) project.
I am interested in time-series, machine-learning (ML), deep-learning and generally artificial intelligence (AI) for industrial and health data. My current work is mainly focused around AI/ML in predictive maintenance. You can find more about my work in my [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marios-Kefalas) or under [Publications](/publications/) or feel free to email me.
I am currently finishing up my PhD and looking for opportunities in industry as a data-scientist/data-analyst.

Besides work/research, I enjoy reading history, learning anything new (literally anything, from random facts all the way to new tech), cooking bolognese, photography and good coffee.
I am always up for a discussion, good food and I love cinematography and movies. Before the Covid-19 pandemic I also did some theatre in Leiden.

I originally come from Glyfada, Athens, Greece where I grew up. I studied at the [department of Mathematics of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.math.uoa.gr/) pure and applied Mathematics (with concentrations on pure)
and then decided to move to The Netherlands for my Master's in Computer Science (Bioinformatics) back in 2015.
